# To Mock a Mockingbird in Lean
This project is a formalization of Parts III and IV of Raymond Smullyan's "To Mock a Mockingbird" into dependent type theory using the Lean proof assistant. Smullyan's book introduces the reader to the field of combinatory logic—a subject central to programming languages and mathematics—through a series of engaging puzzles about talking birds in an enchanted forest.
## Overview 
This repository contains the main story content of the book with the puzzles formalized as lemmas to be proven in Lean. Solution files are also included for reference
## Motivation
As I was working through this book I thought it would be interesting to try and write up some of my solutions in a proof assistant, and it occurred to me that this could be developed into something others could enjoy. The playful nature of these stories along with their rich mathematical foundations makes for a good way to bring some fun into interactive theorem proving, while also teaching users some useful concepts in logic and programming languages, and providing good practice for those learning the Lean language.
## Getting Started 
To begin exploring the forest, navigate to MockAMockingbird > src.
## Progress 
Note that this project is currently a work in progress. At present, only the first problem set from Chapter 9 has been formalized.
## Resources 
A PDF copy of the book, "To Mock a Mockingbird," is included in this repository and can be found as ToMockAMockingBird.pdf.
## Prerequisites
The exercises assume basic Lean experience, nothing more advanced than something like the [Lean Game Server](https://adam.math.hhu.de/). The most in-depth source for learning how to prove theorems in Lean is [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html) by Jeremy Avigad, Leonardo de Moura, Soonho Kong and Sebastian Ullrich. No additional background is required.
