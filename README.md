# To Mock a Mockingbird in Lean
This project is a formalization of Parts III and IV of Raymond Smullyan's "To Mock a Mockingbird" into dependent type theory via the Lean proof assistant. This book introduces combinatory logic through a series of fun puzzles about talking birds in an enchanted forest.

## Overview 
This repository contains the formalization of the puzzles presented in the book as lemmas, which can be proven in Lean. Solutions to the puzzles are also provided for reference.

## Getting Started 
To begin exploring and solving the puzzles, navigate to MockAMockingbird > src.

## Progress 
Note that this project is currently a work in progress. At present, only the first problem set from Chapter 9 has been formalized.

## Resources 
A PDF copy of the book, "To Mock a Mockingbird," is included in this repository and can be found as ToMockAMockingBird.pdf.
