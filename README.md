# To Mock a Mockingbird in Lean
This project is a formalization of Parts III and IV of Raymond Smullyan's "To Mock a Mockingbird" into dependent type theory via the Lean proof assistant. This book presents a series of fun puzzles about talking birds in an enchanted forest to introduce the reader to the field of combinatory logic, a subject central to the foundations of programming languages and mathematics.
## Overview 
This repository contains the formalization of the book content with the puzzles formalized as lemmas to be proven in Lean. Solution files are also included for reference

## Getting Started 
To begin exploring the forest, navigate to MockAMockingbird > src.

## Progress 
Note that this project is currently a work in progress. At present, only the first problem set from Chapter 9 has been formalized.

## Resources 
A PDF copy of the book, "To Mock a Mockingbird," is included in this repository and can be found as ToMockAMockingBird.pdf.

## Prerequisites
The exercises assume basic Lean experience, nothing more advanced than something like the [Lean Game Server](https://adam.math.hhu.de/). The most in-depth source for learning how to prove theorems in Lean is [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html) by Jeremy Avigad, Leonardo de Moura, Soonho Kong and Sebastian Ullrich. No additional background is required.
