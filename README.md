A formalization of Part III of Raymond Smullyan's "To Mock a Mockingbird" into dependent type theory via the Lean proof assistant. This book is an introduction to combinatory logic presented as a series of fun puzzles about talking birds in an enchanted forest.

Puzzles are given as lemmas and can be proven in Lean. Solutions provided. Get started with the puzzles by going to MockAMockingbird > src.

Currently a work in progress. Only have the first problem set from Chapter 9 so far.
